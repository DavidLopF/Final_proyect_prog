### Project development ###
***
The development of our project is divided into a logical part (backend) and a graphic part (frontend), the backend was developed with java and the frontend with css, html, and javascript. We use 2 repositories, one for the backend and one for the frontend. But, when we tried to deploy the front and the back, we could not do it with the githubpage, because the githuppage has an https certificate and the server where we were deploying did not, we could solve it by placing the static resources in the webapp.
